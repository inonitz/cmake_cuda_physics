Actual TODO:
* ImGui
* GPU Side Compute
* 3D Plane
* 3D Visualization


3D:
	FPS Camera
	Infinite XZ Plane
	Draw 3D Buffer of Vertex points, 
	Draw 3D Buffer of Vertex Colours
	-> Draw Single Point with position & colour in 3D of size S (Sphere)



Windows Problems:
1. The imported target "spirv-cross-c-shared" references the file
    "C:/VulkanSDK/1.4.321.0/Lib/lib/spirv-cross-c-shared.lib"
	but this file does not exist.

	From Debugging ->

	A. SDL_shadercross tries to import spirv_cross_c/spirv_cross_core as a dependency inside external/* (git submodule)
	B. Spits out "not found" for a .cmake file inside the vulkan-sdk
	C. I look for the problem, and find the following issue:
		-> https://vulkan.lunarg.com/issue/view/66fef9a807baa3c85a20d08a

	D. even though I specify find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED),
		it still doesn't find the .cmake files inside ${VULKAN_SDK_PATH}\Lib\cmake

	E. So, I do it manually, specifying CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${VULKAN_SDK_PATH}\Lib\cmake,
		so that it can find the cmake config files
	F. I clean build again, but then it complains about incorrect paths,
		Specifically, it adds a "\lib" postfix:
		-> correct  : "C:/VulkanSDK/1.4.321.0/Lib/spirv-cross-c.lib"
		-> incorrect: "C:/VulkanSDK/1.4.321.0/Lib/lib/spirv-cross-c.lib"
	G. looking at "spirv_cross_cConfig-release" that is being imported,
		its seems this is hardcoded.
		I don't know why *YET* it uses a release version on debug, but that may be irrelevant
	H. investigate later

	I. cmake file "spirv_cross_cConfig.cmake that I modified for debugging:
		-> spirv_cross_cConfig.cmake.debugging_attempt
